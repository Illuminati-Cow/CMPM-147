					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>An infinte isometric world generator inhabited by a quickly expanding Dwarven population. Watch as they 
						devour all ore in their paths and carve out the endless caverns of their world.
					</p>
						<h2>Technical</h2>
						<p>The genretor determines tile types via a Perlin noise genreator seeded with the world seed.
							This allows the world to be generated in a deterministic manner. The Dwarves are controlled by an A* pathfinding
							and will seek out ore to mine. The world data is not saved as it is generated at run time via the seed. So,
							surveying the world will not eat up your memory. Zooming out will explode your computer though. Modified tiles are
							recoreded via a hash table to indicate a deviation from the predetermined tile type.
						</p>		
						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>This project went swimmingly and was a joy to work on. I did encounter some serious challenges which included
							coming up with a solution to the A* pathfinding algorithm. I had to modify the algorithm to allow for the Dwarves
							to pathfind in an infitnite world, preventing me from simply loading up all the tiles into a grid. Instead I had
							to create a grid surrounding the start and end points the path and then convert between coordinate spaces.
