				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					This project is a remix of the provided Bad Quest Generator. Instead of
					generating bad quests, it generates bad political manifestos left after
					a revolutionary act. The vocabulary lends itself to funny results though
					some combinations can be a little dark.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					The project is built on a Bad Quest Generator provided in class.
					The generator uses javascript pattern matching using the replace function in a while loop. It loops
					until there are no more matches. The match function matches agains a regex pattern looking for '$'
					followed by a word. The replacer function then randomly selects a word from the vocabulary list
					corresponding to the matched word and replaces the matched word with the selected word. The project
					was modified to include a few new features.
				</p>
				<p>
					To store chosen words I simply set the filler array corresponding to that vocabulary list to only
					include the chosen word. For example, I wanted to store the word chosen for the “oppressor” fill-in.
					So, when the replace method matches with the oppressor regex pattern, the replacer function selects
					a word from the oppressor vocabulary list in the fillers array and then sets the oppressor
					vocabulary list to the selected word. So, when I need to fill in the oppressor fill-in again it will
					choose from a list with only one element which is the previously selected word.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other modification is built on the ability to reuse fill-ins. I wanted to be able to capitalize
					fill-ins that
					started a sentence. The issue was that these fill-ins should not always be capitalized. So, I could
					not just capitalize
					the word in the vocabulary list. Instead, I added a keyword, '$up', that matched the established
					regex pattern: '$word'.
					When the replacer method matches the up keyword it replaces it with an empty string and then sets a
					flag to capitalize
					the next word. On all replacer calls it checks if the flag is set and if so will capitalize the
					first letter of the
					selected word/word sequence and then unset the flag.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					The most challenging part of this project was getting words on the page.
					Filling out the vocabulary lists got tiring quickly especially since
					I was trying to make it at least a little bit funny. I think it turned
					out pretty good and it got a few chuckles from my politi-fan brother.
					The JS was straightforward though the Glitch environment was annoying
					to transition to as it obfuscated the JS and made it difficult to debug.
					I will need to improve my knowledge of the standard JS library and jQuery
					as I am not familiar enough to be able to write code quickly.
					Getting the website to look halfway decent was also a challenge. Copilot
					was quite helpful for jogging my memory on how to do things in HTML and
					CSS. I think the website looks pretty OK for right now considering the time
					invested in it. Adding more words to the vocabulary lists would improve the
					replayability but for a one-off project I think it is fine.
					One thing I would like to add is a way to save the generated manifesto.
					Currently, the manifesto is generated on the page and is lost when the
					page is refreshed. I think it would be cool to have a save button that
					would save the manifesto to a file or cookie.
